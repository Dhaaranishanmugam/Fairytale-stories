            <dt><h2>The Story of The Three Little Pigs</h2></dt>
           
            <b> </b>
            <dd><p>Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived with their mother. As they grew up, their mother decided it was time for them to go out into the world and build their own homes.</p></dd>   

            <b></b>
            <dd><p>The first little pig, being the laziest, built his house out of straw. It only took him a day! He was so proud of himself that he sang a little song: "Little house, little house, all finished in a day! Now I can play, play, play!"</p></dd>   

            <b></b>
            <dd><p>The second little pig wasn't as lazy as his brother, but he wasn't much for hard work either. He built his house out of sticks, which took him a couple of days. Then he joined his brother in singing: "We won't work hard, no sir, not we! We'll build our houses quick and free!"</p></dd>   

            <b></b>
            <dd>The third little pig, however, was very hardworking. He spent weeks gathering bricks and building a strong, sturdy house. His brothers laughed at him, calling him slow and boring. But the third little pig just smiled and kept working.</dd>   

            <b></b>
            <dd><p>One day, a big, bad wolf came along. He saw the first little pig's straw house and thought, "That's an easy meal!" He huffed and he puffed, and blew the straw house right down! The scared little pig ran squealing to his brother's house.</p></dd>   

            <b></b>
            <dd><p>The wolf followed the pigs and saw the house made of sticks. He huffed and he puffed, and blew the stick house down too! The two little pigs scrambled inside their brother's brick house.</p></dd>   

            <b></b>
            <dd><p>The wolf huffed and puffed at the brick house, but it wouldn't budge. He tried climbing up the chimney, but the third little pig had a pot of boiling water waiting for him. With a yelp, the wolf scurried away, never to bother the three little pigs again.</p></dd>   

            <b></b>
            <dd><p>The two older pigs learned their lesson about hard work that day. They moved in with their brother, and all three lived happily ever after in the strong brick house.</p></dd>   

            <b>Moral of the Story:</b>
            <ul><dt><li> <b>Preparation and Hard Work</b></li></dt>
                <dd><p>The tale teaches the importance of putting effort into what you do and being prepared for challenges.</p></dd>
            
                <dt><li><b>Wisdom and Resourcefulness</b></li></dt>
                <dd><p>The third pig's cleverness in building a strong house and outwitting the wolf shows the value of using your intelligence.</p></dd>
            
                <dt><li><b>Consequences of Laziness</b></li></dt>
                <dd><p>The first two pigs suffered because they took shortcuts and didn't plan ahead.</p></dd>
