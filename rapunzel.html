            <dt><h2>The Story of The Rapunzel</h2></dt>
           
            <b> </b>
            <dd><p>Once upon a time, a couple longs for a child. They live next to a walled garden belonging to a sorceress named Dame Gothel. The wife, experiencing intense cravings for the garden's rapunzel (a type of leafy green), convinces her husband to climb over the wall and steal some. Caught by Dame Gothel, he strikes a deal: in return for his life and unlimited access to the rapunzel, he must give her the child his wife will soon bear.</p></dd>   

            <b></b>
            <dd><p>When the child—a girl with beautiful golden hair—is born, Dame Gothel names her Rapunzel and raises her in a tower hidden deep within the forest. The tower has no doors or stairs, only a small window at the top. As Rapunzel grows, her hair becomes remarkably long and serves as the only means for Dame Gothel to access the tower; she calls out, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair," allowing Gothel to climb up.</p></dd>
            <b></b>
            <dd><p>Years pass, and Rapunzel's beauty blossoms. One day, a prince hears Rapunzel singing from the tower and is enchanted by her voice. He watches as Gothel climbs up using Rapunzel's hair, then learns the magic words to gain entry himself. The prince visits Rapunzel in secret, and they fall in love. Eventually, they plan for Rapunzel to escape with the prince, who brings a length of silk to substitute for her hair when they leave.</p></dd>   

            <b></b>
            <dd><p>However, Gothel discovers their plan and cuts Rapunzel's hair, banishing her to a remote desert. When the prince returns and calls out the magic words, Gothel lowers Rapunzel's hair instead. He climbs up and is horrified to find himself face-to-face with Dame Gothel, who mocks him and pushes him from the tower into a thorn bush, blinding him.</p></dd>   

            <b></b>
            <dd><p>The prince wanders the wilderness, blind and desolate, while Rapunzel gives birth to twins, a boy and a girl, in the desert. Years later, fate reunites the prince and Rapunzel, and her tears of joy restore his sight. They return to his kingdom, where they live happily ever after with their children.</p></dd>
