            <b> Gifts for the King</b>
            <dd><p>Puss in Boots ventures out, outsmarts rabbits and partridges, and presents them to the king as gifts from his master, whom he invents a grand title for - the Marquis de Carabas.</p></dd>   

            <b>Encounter by the River</b>

            <b>A Carriage Ride and Quick Thinking</b>
            <dd><p>The king, fooled by Puss's cries, offers help. Puss hides his master and sends him away with some fancy clothes the king provides. Puss then races ahead, warning everyone they meet to say the land belongs to the Marquis de Carabas.</p></dd>
