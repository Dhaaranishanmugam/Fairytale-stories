            <h2>The Story of Beauty and the Beast</h2>
                
            <dt><p><b>Once upon a time,</b></p></dt>
                <dd><p>In a faraway land, there lived a wealthy merchant who had three daughters. The youngest daughter, named Belle, was not only the most beautiful but also the kindest and most intelligent. Her sisters, in contrast, were vain and selfish.</p></dd>
                
                <dt><b>The Merchant's Misfortune</b></dt>
                    <dd><p>One day, the merchant lost all his wealth due to a storm that wrecked his ships. He and his daughters had to move to a small cottage in the countryside and live a humble life. Despite their circumstances, Belle remained cheerful and did her best to keep her family happy.</p></dd>
                <dt><b>A Twist of Fate</b></dt>
                   <dd> <p>Several months later, the merchant heard that one of his ships had survived and made its way back to port. With renewed hope, he set off to reclaim his goods. Before he left, he asked his daughters what they would like him to bring back as gifts. The older sisters requested fine dresses and jewels, but Belle asked only for a single rose.</p></dd>
                <dt><b>The Beast's Castle</b></dt>
                <dd><p>On his way back, the merchant got lost in a forest and stumbled upon a magnificent castle. Inside, he found food and drink laid out for him, and he spent the night there. The next morning, he saw a beautiful rose garden and remembered Belleâ€™s request. He picked a rose, but suddenly, a fearsome Beast appeared and accused him of theft. The Beast demanded that the merchant repay him by either staying forever or sending one of his daughters in his place.</p></dd>
                <b>Belle's Sacrifice</b>
                <dd><p>When the merchant returned home and told his daughters what had happened, Belle bravely volunteered to go to the Beast's castle. Despite her father's protests, she insisted that it was the right thing to do.</p></dd>
                <b>Life with the Beast</b>
                <dd><p>Belle arrived at the castle and was treated with kindness and respect by the Beast. He provided her with beautiful clothes, delicious food, and a luxurious room. Each evening, the Beast would ask Belle to marry him, but she always refused, though politely. Over time, Belle and the Beast became good friends, and she began to see beyond his fearsome exterior.</p></dd>
                <b>The Magic Mirror</b>
                <dd><p>One day, the Beast gave Belle a magic mirror that allowed her to see anything she wished. Through it, she saw her father gravely ill. Heartbroken, she begged the Beast to let her go home to see him. The Beast agreed, though he warned her to return within a week, or he would die of a broken heart.</p></dd>
                <b>A Race Against Time</b>
                <dd><p>Belle's presence revived her father, but her sisters, jealous of her fine clothes and jewels, convinced her to stay longer than a week. Belle soon dreamt that the Beast was dying, and realizing her mistake, she rushed back to the castle.</p></dd>
                <b>True Love's Transformation</b>
                <dd><p>Belle found the Beast lying in the rose garden, barely alive. She wept and confessed her love for him. At that moment, the Beast transformed into a handsome prince. He explained that he had been cursed by a fairy, and only true love could break the spell.</p></dd>
                <b>Happily Ever After</b>
                <dd><p>The prince and Belle were married, and they lived happily ever after in the castle. Belle's family was invited to share in their happiness, and even her sisters learned to be kinder and less selfish. And so, the tale of Beauty and the Beast became a legend, reminding everyone that true beauty lies within.</p></dd>
