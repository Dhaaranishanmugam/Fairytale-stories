            <dt><h2>The Story of Sleeping Beauty</h2></dt>
            <b> The Birth of Aurora</b>
            <dd><p>Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, a king and queen longed for a child. Finally, their wish was granted, and they were blessed with a beautiful baby girl, whom they named Aurora. To celebrate her birth, the king and queen held a grand feast and invited fairies from all over the kingdom to be her godmothers. Each fairy bestowed a gift upon the princess, such as beauty, grace, and musical talent.</p></dd>   

            <b>The Curse</b>
            <dd><p>However, one fairy, Maleficent (or an evil fairy in some versions), who had not been invited to the celebration, arrived in a fit of rage. She cursed the baby princess, declaring that on her sixteenth birthday, Aurora would prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. The last fairy, who had not yet given her gift, altered the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora would fall into a deep sleep for one hundred years, only to be awakened by the kiss of true love.</p></dd>   

            <b>The Precautions </b>
            <dd><p>To protect their daughter, the king and queen ordered all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be destroyed. Despite their efforts, on Aurora's sixteenth birthday, she stumbled upon a hidden spinning wheel in a secluded tower. Curious, she touched the spindle and fell into a deep sleep, fulfilling the curse.</p></dd>   

            <b>The Enchanted Sleep</b>
            <dd><p>The good fairy who had softened the curse cast another spell over the kingdom, causing everyone to fall asleep, so that when Aurora woke, she would not be alone. The castle was surrounded by a dense forest of thorns, shielding it from the outside world.</p></dd>   

            <b>The Prince</b>
            <dd><p>A hundred years passed, and a brave prince from a distant land heard the legend of the sleeping princess. Determined to rescue her, he made his way to the castle, cutting through the thick forest of thorns. He found Aurora in the tower, still in her deep sleep. Overcome by her beauty, he gently kissed her.</p></dd>   

            <b>The Awakening</b>
            <dd><p>Aurora awoke at once, as did the rest of the kingdom. The curse was broken by the power of true love's kiss. The prince and Aurora fell in love and soon married, living happily ever after.</p></dd>
