            <h2>The Story of Cinderella</h2>
            <dd>
                <p>Once upon a time, there was a beautiful, kind-hearted girl named Cinderella, who lived in a faraway land. She lived with her stepmother, Lady Tremaine, and two stepsisters, Anastasia and Drizella. Her stepmother did not like her and made Cinderella live in the attic. Cinderella's best friends became two cute little mice named Gus and Jaq and some chirping birds.</p>
                <p>Her stepmother and stepsisters made her do all the household chores. Cinderella woke up early every morning to start the fire, cook meals, work in the kitchen, and keep the house warm. She always had ashes and cinders on her clothes from the fire, which is why her stepsisters and stepmother called her Cinderella instead of her real name, Ella.</p>
                <p>Anastasia and Drizella were mean and always made Cinderella's life miserable. They made her run errands, cook, sew, and clean. Lady Tremaine enjoyed seeing Cinderella work hard and often gave her extra chores, like bathing her cat, Lucifer.</p>
                <p>One day, the king’s messengers came and announced that the King and Queen were inviting all the maidens of the kingdom to a royal ball. They wanted to find a lovely bride for the Prince. All the young ladies were excited and began planning their best gowns and jewelry.</p>
                <p>When the messenger arrived at Cinderella’s home, Lady Tremaine ordered Cinderella to make beautiful gowns for Anastasia and Drizella. Cinderella wished to go to the ball too, so she found her mother’s old dress and decided to make it beautiful enough for the ball.</p>
                <p>On the day of the ball, Anastasia and Drizella were dressed in the gowns Cinderella made for them. Meanwhile, Gus, Jaq, and the birds transformed Cinderella’s mother’s old dress using ribbons and beads thrown away by the stepsisters. Cinderella was thrilled with her new dress and thought she could go to the ball.</p>
                <p>But when her stepsisters saw her dress, they flew into a rage and tore it apart. Lady Tremaine didn’t stop them and left for the ball with her daughters, leaving Cinderella alone and in tears. Cinderella went to the garden and cried, wishing she could go to the ball.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, a Fairy Godmother appeared. She used her magic to clean Cinderella and gave her a gorgeous gown and amazing glass slippers. With another wave of her wand, she turned a pumpkin into a fine carriage and the mice into carriage-men.</p>
                <p>The Fairy Godmother told Cinderella to enjoy the ball but warned her that the magic would vanish at midnight. Cinderella promised to return before then and left for the ball.</p>
                <p>At the palace, everyone was amazed by Cinderella’s beauty. The Prince couldn’t take his eyes off her and asked her to dance. They spent the evening talking and dancing, and the Prince was smitten by Cinderella's charm.</p>
                <p>As the clock struck midnight, Cinderella remembered the Fairy Godmother’s warning. She quickly left the palace, and in her hurry, one of her glass slippers came off. The Prince tried to follow her but only found the slipper on the stairs.</p>
                <p>The next day, the Prince went from house to house, trying to find the girl who could wear the glass slipper. When he arrived at Cinderella’s house, Anastasia and Drizella tried to fit into the slipper, but it didn’t fit them. The Prince then saw Cinderella and insisted she try it on. The slipper fit perfectly.</p>

            <dt><h2>Moral of the story</h2>
            <dd>One of the significant lessons or morals that you can learn from the story is that “kindness is always rewarded in the end in one form or the other,” and any kind of abuse or cunningness falls flat on its face one day. Cinderella never left her good and forgiving nature and finally got what she deserved- A blissful life.
            <p>Another lesson this fairytale has is don’t stop chasing your dreams, even if the whole world is against you. Have trust, and you will get what you deserve at the end of the day.</p>
